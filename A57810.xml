            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO publi≈øh this to the World, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent it to your Lord≈øhips hands, and by your hands to
the Church, is a Duty of ≈øuch Exigency, that to ≈øeek leave to do it,
<pb facs="tcp:65085:3"/> or to make Apology for it, were as great a Folly, as to omit it were a Crime. For I
pre≈øent nothing of my own, (all that, if any thing, is nothing worth:) but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent what God
in great Wi≈ødom for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages laid up in the inmo≈øt Trea≈øury of his Prophets, peculiarly, of
<hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>I≈øaiah;</hi> and what now in good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he hath di≈øcover'd in
the Very ≈øea≈øon of Time. The Di≈øcovery is his own, and nothing is owing to me, but I am an
hundred fold more than before indebted to his Fatherly Goodne≈øs, whereof this is not the fir≈øt
Experiment of a Thou≈øand. My Lord, however this may appear at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; I dare here engage my
Reputation for ever (which is the greate≈øt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be expected) that in a ≈øhort time
this will appear to be of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and every man that knoweth the
<pb facs="tcp:65085:3"/> terms of this Di≈øcour≈øe, will judge it a vain thing to ≈øeek any other Account of
the Name or Number of the Bea≈øt. This is the End of that Great Controver≈øie of the
Antichri≈øt, <hi>Who he is:</hi> and I hope may prove an effectual end of all Controver≈øie
between Prote≈øtant and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øt. It is the Key of all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies concerning Antichri≈øt,
and for ought I know, may ≈øerve to open all tho≈øe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries of Scripture, Old and New, which
are yet lockt up. Sure I am it will be very comfortable, profitable, and of pre≈øent u≈øe to the
Whole Church. I have a greater and fuller Demon≈øtration of this to make in my next Di≈øcour≈øe.
But I would di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Whole in the ≈øame Order to others, as God has cho≈øen to di≈øcover
it to me. And I de≈øire the help of all my Fellow-labourers in the Vineyard of Je≈øus

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>PROV. xiv. 25.</hi>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Text contains two propo≈øitions. The fir≈øt, a Character of a <hi>True Witne≈øs. A True
Witne≈øs delivereth ≈øouls.</hi> The ≈øecond, a Character of a <hi>Deceitful Witne≈øs, A
Deceitful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ≈øpeaketh lies.</hi> In a late di≈øcour≈øe we ≈øhewed the≈øe Characters
to be very proper; and that they are Prophetical as well as Proverbial: The fir≈øt containing a
Prophecy of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, of <hi>Hed-emeth, the</hi> Great <hi>Witne≈øs of Truth,</hi> who≈øe
Office was to <hi>deliver Souls.</hi> The ≈øecond contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a di≈øtinct Prophecy of the Great
Witne≈øs of <hi>Deceit,</hi> of Antichri≈øt, who, in direct oppo≈øition
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65085:5"/> to Chri≈øt, comes and is come to <hi>de≈øtroy ≈øouls with lies.</hi> We
a≈ø≈øerted al≈øo that the Hebrew Word, which in the text is rendred <hi>A Deceitful
Witne≈øs,</hi> doth plainly, literally and grammatically ≈øignifie <hi>The Lord of Rome.</hi> So
that the whole text is to be rendered thus <hi>verbatim</hi> according to the Hebrew. <hi>The
Witne≈øs of Truth delivereth Souls; but the Lord of Rome ≈øpeaketh lies.</hi> This thing I onely
toucht oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øionally in that di≈øcour≈øe, my de≈øign then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ju≈øtifie the Character
and prophecy of the Witne≈øs of Truth; which having done, I think it nece≈ø≈øary by a peculiar
di≈øcour≈øe to clear that A≈ø≈øertion; both for mine own ≈øake, becau≈øe it is my
A≈ø≈øertion, and I think a≈ø≈øerted by none before: and al≈øo for your ≈øake, that they whom
I ≈øuppo≈øe to de≈øire more certain knowledge of the truth of that A≈ø≈øertion, may, as much
as lieth in me, be fully ≈øatisfied therein: But chiefly for the Truth's ≈øake, which hereby will
greatly be advantag'd; when the fal≈øe Witne≈øs ≈øhall be found ≈øo di≈øtinctly reveal'd. For
if we can make it plain, that the Holy Gho≈øt has couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Truth in this Proverb, and has by
the pen of <hi>Solomon</hi> di≈øtinctly nam'd <hi>the Lord of Rome</hi> as <hi>the Deceitful
Witne≈øs that ≈øpeaketh lies,</hi> and that in direct oppo≈øition to <hi>the Witne≈øs of Truth
that delivereth Souls;</hi> if this be made plain,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65085:5"/> it will put an end to all Controver≈øies between other Churches and
<hi>Rome.</hi> For the Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> will not only forfeit his Infallibility, that great
Shield of his Papacy and Supremacy; but the World too will deny him to be the Vicar of Chri≈øt,
and will look upon him as the Great Antichri≈øt, and, next to Satan, <hi>the Father of lies.</hi>
This will certainly come to pa≈øs, if men can once read in expre≈øs terms of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
that as <hi>the true Witne≈øs,</hi> which is Chri≈øt, <hi>delivereth Souls;</hi> ≈øo <hi>the
Lord of Rome ≈øpeaketh lies.</hi> Now this, with the help of That <hi>True Witne≈øs,</hi> we
≈øhall ≈øhew undeniably, not conjecturally, to be the expre≈øs terms of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
expre≈øt with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of Wi≈ødom and Truth that became that Spirit by which
<hi>Solomon</hi> wrote or ≈øpoke. To the full proof whereof, premi≈øe we,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though the Di≈øcovery be clear and evident to tho≈øe that can be brought to
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, yet it mu≈øt not nece≈ø≈øarily be evident to all that hear; for all that hear
cannot be brought to under≈øtand. So the Di≈øcovery of the New World of <hi>America</hi> was
pre≈øently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all that <hi>Columbus</hi> could bring thither to ≈øee that World; but
mo≈øt of other men, who would not go to ≈øee it, would not pre≈øently believe it; but now that
≈øo many have ≈øeen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65085:6"/> it, I think almo≈øt all men believe it. So I ≈øhall do my endeavour to bring
men to the knowledge of this Truth, that by their own under≈øtanding it may be evident to them, as
it is evident to me; and when it is evident to Many, the re≈øt will believe as they ought.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the thing is di≈øcover'd, it will be certain and evident, as we have ju≈øt now
≈øaid: but the Di≈øcovery mu≈øt not be ea≈øie nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, nor therefore to be rejected
becau≈øe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet made. This is plain in re≈øpect of all Prophecies, as Chri≈øt ob≈øerv'd to
his Apo≈øtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.15. ≈øpeaking of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy of the <hi>Abomination
of de≈øolation; Who≈øo readeth,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>let him under≈øtand.</hi> As if
Chri≈øt had ≈øaid, Many have read that Prophecy, and you have read it, but who hath under≈øtood
it? None; but I tell ye now plainly, that it is the utter De≈øtruction of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi>
which you ≈øhall live to ≈øee. Even ≈øo; many have read this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but
it follows not that any hath under≈øtood it, till the appointed time, which I ≈øhall ≈øhew ye,
is now. But this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical ob≈øcurity is mo≈øt peculiar to our ca≈øe, which contains the
Di≈øcovery of the Name of Antichri≈øt, and of the Number of his Name. For of this very thing, it
is written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65085:6"/> him≈øelf, who ≈øpeaks mo≈øt of this matter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Here is
wi≈ødom,</hi> ≈øays the Great Prophet <hi>John. Let him that hath under≈øtanding count the
Number,</hi> &amp;c. Beloved, be ye ≈øo far from expecting ≈øomething obvious to every man that
readeth; that rather reject ye this A≈ø≈øertion, if ye find not both Wi≈ødom and
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding in it; yet not my wi≈ødom, or the wi≈ødom of man; but the wi≈ødom of the Holy
Gho≈øt, who knew how to couch ≈øo valuable a Prophecy under the contemptible covert of a ≈øingle
term of <hi>Solomon:</hi> And now to di≈øcover it by a contemptible In≈øtrument, when the very
time calls for it. Nay, not the Wi≈ødom only, but the Goodne≈øs of God is apparent in the≈øe
long concealments of prophetical Truths, and the open Revelation of them in their proper times. For
in≈øtance, had <hi>Solomon</hi> writ in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and obvious terms, that <hi>the Lord of Rome
≈øpeaketh lies;</hi> Then had <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Books at lea≈øt, if not all the old Scriptures,
been burnt by the Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> without ≈øome extraordinary Miracles of pre≈øervation,
which did not ≈øo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come divine Wi≈ødom, who knew how to order the matter better without them.
Again, had <hi>Solomon</hi> writ this in terms obvious to every Reader, or had it been di≈øcover'd
before the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65085:7"/> time; then ≈øuch Lords of <hi>Rome</hi> as have been Witne≈ø≈øes of Truth,
had been branded with an undue Character: Now then is the time, that this Prophecy ≈øhould be
di≈øcover'd, and fir≈øt here in <hi>England;</hi> for here fir≈øt, by the mo≈øt wonderful
Di≈øcoveries that ever were made in the world, the Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> appears to be indeed,
that Great <hi>Witne≈øs of deceit</hi> who <hi>≈øpeaketh lies,</hi> and by Lies de≈øtroyeth
tho≈øe Souls which the great Witne≈øs of Truth came to deliver.</p>
            <p>Proceed we directly to the Di≈øcovery. The thing to be di≈øcovered lyes hid in the Hebrew
term, which in the Text is render'd <hi>A deceitful Witne≈øs.</hi> The Hebrew term is in the
fir≈øt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal written with the≈øe four letters onely, <hi>M. R. M. H:</hi> Now the Hebrews,
till above four hundred years after Chri≈øt, writ no Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in their words, as <hi>a, e, i,
o,</hi> or <hi>u,</hi> but writ the Con≈øonants only, and under≈øtood the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Which Cu≈øtom
of that Language God him≈øelf was the Author of, when he gave his Law to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> written
without di≈øtinction of Vowels: and I cannot doubt but the Divine Wi≈ødom appointed it ≈øo, to
this very end, that many things and prophecies might lye hid in that ob≈øcure Writing, till a
proper time to be di≈øcover'd. And ≈øo it came to pa≈øs; for the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65085:7"/> Chri≈øtians, di≈øcovering daily more and more te≈øtimonies of the Truth from
the Old Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and confounding the ob≈øtinate <hi>Jews</hi> with their own writings; the
<hi>Ma≈øorethans,</hi> that they might either change or ob≈øcure ≈øuch places in Scripture as
plainly made for the Chri≈øtians again≈øt them, found out this trick of writing Vowels, [which
however in it ≈øelf a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of writing, yet was in them but a trick of corrupting]: and
≈øeveral places, which they could not corrupt, they utterly rejected, even the whole Book of
<hi>Daniel;</hi> and con≈øulted to ≈øerve <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> ≈øo, but publick ≈øhame could not
permit that. But Prophecies of the nature of the Text, which lay hid in clo≈øe Coverts of words
admitting another vulgar ≈øence, as this word <hi>Mirmah</hi> doth; ≈øuch they could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to change; for they could not ≈øu≈øpect any prophecy in them: and I know there are more in the
Scripture, and there may be many more which I know not, in which the Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ≈øhines
wonderfully to him that under≈øtandeth, and his gracious Providence to pre≈øerve his Truth from
them that would ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs it utterly, were it in their skill and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The≈øe
<hi>Ma≈øorethans</hi> added their points and vowels to all the Words, of the Old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65085:8"/> 
               <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> 479. twelve hundred years agoe at the mo≈øt. From this,</p>
            <p>'Tis plain, that the Vowels of this word <hi>Mirmah</hi> are not of Divine Authority, unle≈øs
we have other authority than that of the Ma≈øore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans. But the Letters of the word being
ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally written by <hi>Solomon</hi> are of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that is, <hi>M. R. M. H:</hi>
which Letters according to the exact analogy of the Hebrew reading, make the entire word of
<hi>Maromah,</hi> of which <hi>Mirmah</hi> is only a contraction: for the Word <hi>Maromah</hi>
gives every letter its Vowel; but the word <hi>Mirmah</hi> ca≈øts out the middle-vowel,
<hi>O,</hi> from the letter <hi>R,</hi> and for the long vowel, <hi>A,</hi> puts the ≈øhort vowel
<hi>i,</hi> and ≈øo draws together three Syllables into two; <hi>Maromah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Mirmah.</hi> So that the whole difference is from the Vowels only, which, as all confe≈øs, are
not Divine Scripture. If then the Letters, which are certainly of Divine authority, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in
them a more profitable Truth, than what is expre≈øt by the Ma≈øorethans pointing of it; and if
that Truth be plainly confirm'd by other Scriptures; then without all doubt we ought to embrace
that Truth, and to u≈øe the words of the Holy Gho≈øt to the greate≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it. So,
≈øeeing the Scripture of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65085:8"/> Holy Gho≈øt is really and literally <hi>Maromah</hi> as well as
<hi>Mirmah,</hi> we may read <hi>Maromah</hi> as well as <hi>Mirmah;</hi> yea, rather
<hi>Maromah</hi> than <hi>Mirmah,</hi> if <hi>Maromah</hi> be more ≈øignificant and conform to the
Holy Gho≈øt in the other Scriptures, as we ≈øhall ≈øhew it is. We reject not the word
<hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah;</hi> no; But</p>
            <p>We preferre the Word <hi>Maromah,</hi> for rea≈øons to be given: and we retain the word
<hi>Mirmah,</hi> which in its vulgar u≈øe ≈øignifies <hi>Deceit;</hi> and ≈øo was a mo≈øt fit
word to conceal the Prophecy included in <hi>Maromah,</hi> which <hi>Mirmah</hi> too includes in
its radical ≈øignification; yea, is the ≈øame Word e≈ø≈øentially with <hi>Maromah,</hi> and is
the ≈øame word, letter for letter, in the Original writing of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which was the
writing of the Holy Gho≈øt: It was nece≈ø≈øary then it ≈øhould be read <hi>Mirmah,</hi> till
the di≈øcovery of the Prophecy of <hi>Maromah</hi> contained in it. But when the Kernel mu≈øt be
produced, then the Shell mu≈øt be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Then leave we <hi>Mirmah</hi> as the Shell; and prove
we the property of <hi>Maromah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maromah,</hi> literally and grammatically, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to exact Lexico-graphy and Etymology
of the Hebrew tongue; and which is more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ≈øtyle of the Prophets, Old and New,
≈øignifies <hi>the Lord of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65085:9"/>I will fir≈øt prove the grammatical, and then the prophetical ≈øignification
of the Word. The Grammatical ≈øignification is apparent three wayes; all as plain as Grammatical
things can be, only, as was premi≈øed, it mu≈øt not be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Every Grammarian, nor to be
read in the School-Dictionary; for then where's the My≈øtery? of which it is ≈øaid, <hi>Let him,
that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, under≈øtand. And here is Wi≈ødom. And let him, that under≈øtandeth, count the
Number,</hi> &amp;c. But you ≈øhall ≈øee the Wi≈ødom of God ≈øhine out from a ≈øingle word;
even from this word of <hi>Maromah.</hi> Only have patience, and de≈øpi≈øe not ≈ømall things,
which the wi≈øe God makes choice of to confound the things that are great.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, to fore≈øhew <hi>the Lord of Rome,</hi> which is ≈øpiritually <hi>Babylon,</hi>
the Spirit would u≈øe a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> word; for <hi>Maromah</hi> is an Hebrew word in the
Babylonian Dialect; for <hi>Mar,</hi> ≈øays <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfius,</hi> is <hi>Vox babylonica,</hi> and
≈øignifies a <hi>Supreme Lord,</hi> and is often u≈øed by the Rabbies, ≈øayes the ≈øame
<hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> for <hi>Bahal,</hi> or <hi>Adon:</hi> and not only by the Rabbies, but by the
Holy Gho≈øt too, both in the Old and New Prophets, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.47. <hi>Maremalchin,</hi> a
Babylonian word, for <hi>the Lord of Kings,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. <hi>Maranatha,</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
word, for <hi>the Lord cometh:</hi> Even ≈øo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65085:9"/> 
               <hi>Maromah,</hi> for <hi>the Lord of Rome.</hi> For <hi>Rome</hi> is
Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally a Hebrew word, and the Hebrews have no other word for <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Roum</hi>
in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Dialect, and <hi>Romah</hi> in the Babylonian or Chaldaick dialect, whence comes the
Greek word <hi>RomŒ∑,</hi> with an Œ∑ in the end; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers the Hebrews <hi>He;</hi>
and from the Greek came the Latin word, by turning Œ∑ into <hi>a,</hi> as in <hi>cena,
mu≈øa,</hi> and a thou≈øand ≈øuch. Indeed the Greek and Latin tongues come originally from the
Hebrew, as <hi>Arpenius</hi> has learnedly ≈øhown; but e≈øpecially this word <hi>Rome</hi> came
from the Hebrew, as will better appear by the con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Hebrew, <hi>Roum,</hi> which
you may ≈øee in every Lexicon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roum</hi> is an Hebrew Verb, and ≈øignifies to be High and exalted, or to exalt Ones-≈øelf
in place, power, and pride, or to u≈øurp high and great things, chiefly indeed it is ≈øpoken of
the exaltation of God above all, as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Know that I am God,</hi> ≈øays the
Lord; <hi>I will be exalted among the Heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. Aroum baggojim,
aroum baarets.</hi> But ≈øecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, the word is u≈øed, for the pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
u≈øurpation of men, as we ≈øhall ≈øee. From the Verb <hi>Roum</hi> come the Sub≈øtantives,
<hi>Roum,</hi> and <hi>Romah;</hi> both which ≈øignifie Height
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65085:10"/> in place, power, or pride, from which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes the name of the City of
<hi>Rome.</hi> From the ≈øame Verb you have al≈øo <hi>Maroum,</hi> which is the principal Word we
look for, and you have it in every Hebrew Lexicon. See <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> in the Radix
<hi>Roum.</hi> Now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receiv'd ≈øignification of <hi>Maroum,</hi> in the Lexicons, is,
<hi>The high One</hi> of the Earth, or <hi>the High thing</hi> of the Earth; to which if ye joyn
the fir≈øt Etymology, in which is ≈øhewn that <hi>Mar</hi> is an u≈øual term for <hi>Lord;</hi>
then it will appear plainly that <hi>Maroum,</hi> as <hi>Maromah,</hi> ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies literally and
grammatically <hi>the Lord of Rome.</hi> For as it appears in <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> in the Radix
<hi>Roum,</hi> that the Sub≈øtantives <hi>Roum,</hi> and <hi>Romah,</hi> are all One; ≈øo it
mu≈øt needs be equally plain, that <hi>Maroum,</hi> and <hi>Maromah,</hi> are all One.</p>
            <p>But if ye ask, which of the≈øe is the proper and Original Word? <hi>Maroum</hi> certainly with
<hi>Vau-cholam,</hi> is the Original Hebrew word in the Hebrew dialect; and <hi>Maromah</hi> in the
Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean or Babylonian dialect. The Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Vau-cholam</hi> is certainly very hard,
and I think quite lo≈øt among the Hebrews them≈øelves: but as for the Greeks and Latins, who have
no <hi>Vau-cholam</hi> in their Language, neither can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65085:10"/> pronounce it; the Greeks are forced to take an Œ∑ in the end, and for
<hi>Roum</hi> ≈øay <hi>RomŒ∑:</hi> the Latins take an <hi>a,</hi> and ≈øay <hi>Roma;</hi> the
Engli≈øh take an <hi>e quie≈øcent</hi> and ≈øay <hi>Rome.</hi> And all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the
difficulty of pronouncing <hi>Vau-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> in the word <hi>Roum,</hi> or rather <hi>Rovm.</hi>
After the ≈øame manner the Original Word, <hi>Maroum,</hi> with <hi>Vau-cholam,</hi> is after the
Greek fa≈øhion, <hi>Maromeh;</hi> after the Latin, <hi>Maromah;</hi> after the Engli≈øh,
<hi>Marome,</hi> with an <hi>e quie≈øcent;</hi> all which alters not the ≈øignification of the
word, but the pronunciation of it only. So <hi>homo</hi> in Latine is made <hi>huomo</hi> in
Italian, <hi>Hombre</hi> in Spani≈øh, <hi>un homme</hi> in French, yet all are Originally the
≈øame word with <hi>homo,</hi> a man. Much more ea≈øie is it to conceive <hi>Maroum</hi> and
<hi>Maromah,</hi> to be the ≈øame word in the Hebrew tongue, which counts not the difference of
Vowels, nor of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, but chiefly of e≈ø≈øential or radical let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For which,</p>
            <p>Ob≈øerve, that the Radix <hi>Roum</hi> has two cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and collateral Radixes, one on one
≈øide, and the other on the other: That is, <hi>Marah</hi> and <hi>Ramah. Marah</hi> with an
<hi>Aleph,</hi> whence comes <hi>Mar</hi> a Lord, or one that exalts him≈øelf, has the ≈øame
≈øignification with <hi>Roum, to exalt it ≈øelf:</hi> but <hi>Marah</hi> with an <hi>He,</hi>
≈øignifies to Rebell,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65085:11"/> which is a thing con≈øequent to pride. <hi>Ramah</hi> is of the ≈øame
radical letters with <hi>Roum,</hi> only <hi>He</hi> in the end is put for <hi>Vau</hi> the middle;
which, as we ≈øhewed, is an u≈øual thing; and <hi>Ramah</hi> ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to <hi>deceive;</hi>
and thence comes <hi>Remijah</hi> and <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> Deceit; So that however the words be
ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; whether <hi>Roum</hi> or <hi>Romah;</hi> whether <hi>Mirmah, Maroum,</hi> or
<hi>Maromah;</hi> whether from <hi>Marah, Roum</hi> or <hi>Ramah;</hi> take the words as you will,
it ≈øtill will appear, that God has lodg'd the My≈øtery of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Lord of
<hi>Rome</hi> in the≈øe words, which ≈øignifie Pride, Rebellion, U≈øurpation and Deceit, the
certain di≈øtinctive Characters of that proud City, and of the lofty Lord that rules therein, who
has deceiv'd the Nations with his Lies. This then is the plain i≈ø≈øue of this long Grammatical
di≈øcour≈øe, that the word of the Text, which is render'd <hi>a Deceitful Witne≈øs,</hi> is
literally and grammatically to be render'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roum</hi> or <hi>Maromah,</hi> that is, <hi>the
Lord of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the Grammatical; come we now to the Prophetical property, u≈øe and
≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of this word. And fir≈øt, Ob≈øerve: That the Word <hi>Mirmah,</hi> though it
≈øignifies in its common u≈øe, <hi>Deceit, in genere,</hi> yet the Scriptures u≈øe it not, but
where Antichri≈øt is foretold or ≈øpoken of; which argues the peculiar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65085:11"/> of that word to that purpo≈øe. Be≈øides the Text, I have noted ≈øix places
in this Book of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> where <hi>Solomon</hi> u≈øeth this word, and they have all
a peculiar application to <hi>the Deceitful Witne≈øs, Antichri≈øt,</hi> as the Text hath. The
like may be ob≈øerved in the other Books, as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt de≈øtroy them
that ≈øpeak lea≈øing: the Lord ≈øhall de≈øtroy the bloody and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man.</hi> The Word is
<hi>Mirmah</hi> or <hi>Maromah.</hi> And P≈øal. 10.7. <hi>His mouth is full of cur≈øing, and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and fraud.</hi> The Word again is <hi>Mirmah</hi> or <hi>Maromah.</hi> And the≈øe places
mean plainly of Antichri≈øt. But where the place is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the deceit of Antichri≈øt,
there Deceit is not expre≈øt by the Word <hi>Mirmah,</hi> but by <hi>Remijah, toke,</hi> or ≈øome
other word.</p>
            <p>But for the Prophetical u≈øe of this word, we have undeniable Authority in the Prophet
<hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> in the 24<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> and 26<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> Chapters: In which the Prophet foretells
the Judgement of God upon <hi>Rome,</hi> calling the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 24.4. <hi>The haughty
people of the earth.</hi> The Hebrew word is, <hi>Meroum ham ha√§rets;</hi> that is, The
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romah</hi> people of the earth, or the People of <hi>Maroum</hi> or <hi>Maromah, The Lord of
Rome:</hi> or it may be render'd, <hi>the Maroum</hi> of the people of the earth, that is, the
<hi>Roman Lord</hi> of the people
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65085:12"/> of the earth, or the Supreme Lord of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the earth. For we ≈øhewed
that <hi>Maroum</hi> is the true Original writing, or pronunciation of the Word: And <hi>v.</hi>
21. <hi>It ≈øhall come to pa≈øs, in that day, that the Lord ≈øhall puni≈øh the ho≈øt of the
High ones that are on high, and the Kings of of the earth upon the earth.</hi> The Hebrew calls it
<hi>Zeba hammaroum bammaroum,</hi> that is, <hi>verbatim, The ho≈øt of the high One in the high
One;</hi> he will puni≈øh <hi>Maroum</hi> in <hi>Maroum,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord of Rome in his
own per≈øon;</hi> or, he will puni≈øh the high Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> in the high City of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Kings of the earth that join with him; and Chap. 26.5. <hi>He bringeth
down them that dwell on high, the lofty City he layeth it low.</hi> The Hebrew is,
<hi>Jo≈øheb√´ Maroum, the inhabitants of Maroum,</hi> that is, the people of the Lord of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or the people of the high or proud City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then <hi>Maroum</hi> is a
prophetical term for Antichri≈øt, which I might ≈øhew in many more places; but I ≈øhall ≈øhew
it agreeable to the ≈øtyle of Chri≈øt too and of his Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maroum,</hi> as every Lexicon will ≈øhew ye, ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies him that exalts him≈øelf on
high. Now this is the very di≈øtinctive term that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> have
u≈øed for Antichri≈øt. Chri≈øt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Who≈øoever exalteth him≈øelf, ≈øhall
be aba≈øed;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65085:12"/> and he that humbleth him≈øelf, ≈øhall be exalted.</hi> Which, though it
obviou≈øly be under≈øtood of every proud or humble man; yet is primarily to be under≈øtood of
the Exaltation of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe of his voluntary Humility: and of the de≈øtruction of
Antichri≈øt, becau≈øe of his proud U≈øurpations. <hi>Paul</hi> following the ≈øtyle of
Chri≈øt, ≈øpeaks plainly of Antichri≈øt, and calls him the <hi>Maroum,</hi> 2 The≈ø≈ø. 2.4.
<hi>Who exalteth him≈øelf above all.</hi> This is, the <hi>Maroum, The Lord of Rome,</hi> who has
made him≈øelf Supreme, that is, <hi>Maroum,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted over all.</p>
            <p>What need we ≈øay more? We have ≈øaid this to ≈øatisfie Criticks in Grammar and Style. But if
any man be not ≈øatisfied with this; we have yet an undenyable Argument, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roum, the
Lord of Rome</hi> is. The Antichri≈øt: and that <hi>Maroum</hi> is his Name; Even the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
the Holy Gho≈øt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18. <hi>His Number is ≈øix hundred three≈øcore and ≈øix.</hi>
We ≈øhall ≈øhew this ≈øo clearly, that no ≈øcruple can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and you ≈øhall ≈øee, that
<hi>here is Wi≈ødom,</hi> even the Wi≈ødom of God, to pre≈øerve his Truth in a Word: and here is
Under≈øtanding without errour, to count the Number of the Bea≈øt. And that ye may know, how plain
it is to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ≈øhall give fir≈øt an Example of the like work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65085:13"/>As it is foretold of Antichri≈øt, that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Name ≈øhall be 666.
≈øo was it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Je≈øus, that the Number of his Name ≈øhould be 888. See we then how the
Name of Je≈øus makes up that number of 888. and then if the Name <hi>Maroum</hi> make up in like
manner the Number of 666. then our work is done. The Name of Je≈øus in the Greek tongue has ≈øix
letters, Œπ, Œ∑, Œ¥, Œø, œÖ, œÇ</p>
            <p>The≈øe ≈øix letters make the Number of 888, thus: Œπ, 10. Œ∑, 8. Œ¥, 200. Œø, 70.
œÖ, 400. œÇ, again, 200. The≈øe put together, make 888. 200, and 200, and 400, make 800.
and 70, and 10, make 80. and the Œ∑ 8.</p>
            <p>Even ≈øo does this Name of <hi>Maroum</hi> make the Number of 666. For it contains originally,
as we ≈øhewed ye, four letters, <hi>M, R, V, M.</hi> no more, and no le≈øs. Now in the Hebrew
account, <hi>M.</hi> ≈øtands for forty, <hi>R.</hi> as the twentieth letter in Order, is twenty;
See <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.123. the twentieth part: there's ≈øixty of our Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the two fir≈øt
letters. <hi>V.</hi> is the ≈øixth letter in the Alphabet, and makes the odd 6; and <hi>M.</hi>
final, that is, <hi>M.</hi> as it is ≈øhapen in the end of a word, for ≈øo in the Hebrew it has a
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ≈øhape, ≈øtands alwayes for ≈øix hundred: So ye have the whole Number of the Bea≈øt
666.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65085:13"/> in the Name of <hi>Maroum;</hi> ju≈øt as ye had 888. in the Name of Je≈øus.
Thus you ≈øee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>John</hi> fulfill'd concerning the Number of the Name of
Antichri≈øt; after the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as the Prophecy of the <hi>Sybilla</hi> was fulfilled
concerning the Number of the Name of Je≈øus. In both you ≈øee the Wi≈ødom of God, that can
pre≈øerve the Truth, and foretell things to come in a ≈øingle Name: and you ≈øee in both
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding given to men to count the My≈øteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Numbers of My≈øterious Per≈øons;
Chri≈øt the Great Witne≈øs of Truth, and Antichri≈øt the great Witne≈øs of Deceit.</p>
            <p>There remains a petty Scruple or two: 1. Why was not the Name of Antichri≈øt to be number'd in
Greek, as the Name of <hi>Je≈øus?</hi> The an≈øwer is ea≈øie. The Uniformity is better as it is.
For as Chri≈øt an Hebrew, was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd in Greek, ≈øo Antichri≈øt a Roman, is number'd in
Hebrew. If ye ask, why not an Hebrew in Hebrew; and a Roman in Roman? I an≈øwer, Fir≈øt, perhaps
to prevent ≈øu≈øpicion; le≈øt if the Names had been number'd in their Mother-tongues, it might
be taken for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of their own Mother or Countrey. There is ≈øecondly, another good
rea≈øon. Chri≈øt was ≈øent to the Nations, to teach them the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65085:14"/> Wi≈ødom of God, therefore his Name was to be numbred in the language of the
Wi≈ødom of the Nations, which then was the Greek tongue: But now Antichri≈øt is the great
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Lord of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ≈øpiritually ≈øo called; therefore his Name is number'd
in the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Language; for as we ≈øaid, <hi>Maromah</hi> in both ends, and <hi>Maroum</hi>
too in the fir≈øt Syllable, are Hebrew words in a Babylonian dialect. So all things are
proper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Scruple may be made. Why is not Antichri≈øts Name to be number'd an Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Name; ≈øeeing the Name of Je≈øus is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual? I an≈øwer, There is but One Chri≈øt
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; and therefore his Name mu≈øt needs be individual. But Antichri≈øts are many: but the
greate≈øt of Antichri≈øts is the Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Lord of Rome which exalteth
him≈øelf as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme above all;</hi> and becau≈øe there is but One at a time, though many at once
may fight for it; the many, that ≈øucceed one another, are by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion made One, but
cannot be One individual; ≈øo no individual name of Antichri≈øt can be number'd, but a Specifical
Name. Now the mo≈øt ≈øpecifical Name that can be thought on, is this of <hi>Maroum,</hi> or
<hi>Maromah,</hi> or <hi>Lord of Rome;</hi> which is al≈øo to ≈øay, <hi>Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65085:14"/> over all;</hi> Or <hi>Lord ≈øupreme.</hi> Therefore, we have rightly cho≈øen
this Name to number; and we know we have cho≈øen aright. For as we know the Name of Chri≈øt by
the Number of 888. ≈øo we know the Name of Antichri≈øt by the revealed Number of 666. Re≈øt we
then here, for I know not the lea≈øt ≈øcruple remaining. Yea, I know, whoever ≈øhall ≈øeek
another Name or Number of the Bea≈øt, ≈øhall ≈øeek in vain. Nothing is here of my own making.
Neither Word nor Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor Letter, nor Number. The Word of <hi>Maroum</hi> is of the
Prophets. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 24, 25, 26, <hi>chapt.</hi> The Signification of the Word, you may ≈øee
in <hi>Buxtorfius;</hi> and in every Hebrew Lexicon. The Letters and the Number of the Letters you
have in every Hebrew Alphabet: but mo≈øt di≈øtinctly and prophetically in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.
My work was onely this, to under≈øtand what I read, and ≈øo to collect it as to give you the
under≈øtanding. I doubt not but more time will give both you and me more under≈øtanding. But God
gave me this, and I hope will give as much more as is good for me: and this is enough for this time
of this matter. Let the Text be read thus: <hi>The Witne≈øs of Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth ≈øouls: But
Maroum, The Lord of Rome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65085:15"/> speaketh lies.</hi> Then a word or two to that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, Speaketh
lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øpeaketh Lies two wayes; By Him≈øelf, and by his Emi≈ø≈øaries.
Fir≈øt, The Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øpeaketh Lies by him≈øelf. We ≈øhall not undertake to give
ye the Number of his Lies, as we gave ye the Number of his Name; for we might better give the
Number of the Starres, or of the Sand of the Ocean-≈øhore. But, as the Starres are reduced to
Cla≈ø≈øes, ≈øo ≈øhall we reduce the Lies of the Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> to three Cla≈ø≈øes;
that is, of Doctrine, of Di≈øcipline, and of Manners.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt and fundamental Lye of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Maromah</hi> is, That he has
a≈ø≈øerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf <hi>Infallible,</hi> and that he cannot erre when he ≈øpeaks in his
<hi>Chair.</hi> This is the Mother of Lyes, and he the Father. And with this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Infallibility</hi> he hath begot an innumerable I≈ø≈øue of Lies, and hath put them out to be
e≈øpou≈øed by all Nations; and many Nations have been deceiv'd with them the≈øe many Ages: But
thanks be to God and to our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Truth, Je≈øus Chri≈øt; for he by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel has
di≈øcover'd the≈øe lyes unto us, and has deliver'd our Souls from this Witne≈øs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Our
Witne≈ø≈øes of Truth, which the Lord
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65085:15"/> hath rai≈øed up from time to time in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, have confounded
<hi>Maromah</hi> in thou≈øands of Controver≈øies. We at Pre≈øent deny his A≈ø≈øertion of
Infallibility, and that not from our own mouth, but from the Mouth of the Holy Gho≈øt, who
≈øpeaking by <hi>Solomon,</hi> hath ≈øaid unto us, <hi>Maromah, The Lord of Rome speaketh lies:
Ergo,</hi> is not Infallible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Great and Fundamental Lye of his Di≈øcipline is this, That he is the Vicar and
Sub≈øtitute of Chri≈øt, The Supreme Lord over the Chri≈øtian World, exalted by Chri≈øt over
Kings and Princes, and over all that is called God on Earth. With this his Lye he has got the
Crowns of Kings and Emperours into his hand, and has brought Kings and Emperours under his feet,
and di≈øpo≈øeth of them and of their Kingdoms as he plea≈øeth, giveth the Life of Kings into the
hands of Murderers, and the Murderers of Kings are his Martyrs; Ma≈ø≈øacres of Nations are his
Holy Leagues, and the mo≈øt helli≈øh Plots are the mo≈øt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Works of his be≈øt
beloved Sons and Subjects. But Now this Lye is laid open to the World. <hi>Maromah</hi> is proved
to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Witne≈øs directly oppo≈øite to the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Truth which is Chri≈øt,
and therefore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65085:16"/> the Antichri≈øt, and not the Vicar of Chri≈øt. Yea, his own mouth betrayes
him; for he profe≈ø≈øedly exalts him≈øelf above all on Earth; Therefore he's the
<hi>Maroum,</hi> who≈øe Number is 666. And of him it is written, <hi>Maromah speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Great and fundamental Lye of his Manners is this, that he ≈øtyles him≈øelf,
<hi>The mo≈øt Holy,</hi> and <hi>The mo≈øt Humble</hi> too, even <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Servants
of God.</hi> But certainly he's the mo≈øt unholy and the mo≈øt proud; the mo≈øt de≈øtructive
and the mo≈øt abominable evil among men; and therefore termed by the Holy Gho≈øt, not a Man but a
Bea≈øt. And the Bi≈øhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øince they were <hi>Maroums,</hi> that is, ≈øince
they u≈øurp'd Supremacy, have been the mo≈øt cruel, bloody, mo≈øt filthy and abominable Bea≈øts
in Nature; that the name of Bea≈øt was never ≈øo agreeable to any thing on Earth, as to the Popes
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great was the fir≈øt who took that Title of <hi>The Servant of the
Servants of God:</hi> not in a ≈øpirit of Humility, but of the greate≈øt Pride and Envy. For, the
Emperour prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>John Jejunator</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Gregory,</hi> and giving <hi>John</hi> the title of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Bi≈øhop: Gregory</hi>
oppenly oppo≈øing <hi>Johns</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65085:16"/> Supremacy, took it upon him≈øelf the be≈øt way he could, by the equivocal
Title of <hi>Servant of the Servants of God.</hi> In the mean time neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Stratagems to
promote his Supreme Authority. For which ≈øole end, he ≈øent his Agents, <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> and
the other Monks into <hi>England,</hi> to lay the foundation of his U≈øurpations there. So that of
a truth <hi>Gregory</hi> was the Fir≈øt <hi>Maroum,</hi> at lea≈øt in plot and de≈øign: but his
Succe≈ø≈øour <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, was an open and profe≈øt One, who obtain'd of
<hi>Phocas</hi> Emperour the Title of <hi>Supreme Bi≈øhop and Lord of the Church.</hi> And the
U≈øurpation had ≈øuch ≈øucce≈øs, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, in ≈øolemn Jubilee,
Attired one day in <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> another in <hi>Imperialibus,</hi> with two Swords
before him, made Proclamation that he was Supreme Lord and Emperour of the Whole World, and
Accur≈øed all the Kings of the Earth that ≈øubjected not their Kingdoms to him.</p>
            <p>So egregious is that Lye of the Title of <hi>Mo≈øt Holy,</hi> and of <hi>the Servant of the
Servants of God,</hi> that ≈øince the time of that mo≈øt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Hypocrite <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Great, there has not reign'd One Pope but what has been a mon≈øtrous Bea≈øt in Manners; All
mon≈øtrous in Pride, Covetou≈øne≈øs, Rebellion, Deceit, U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65085:17"/> and Impo≈øtures: And Mo≈øt, profe≈øt Athei≈øts, Whoremongers, Sodomites,
Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks, Blood-≈øhedders, Incendiaries, ≈øo unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in plotting and rai≈øing Warres among
Chri≈øtian Kings and Princes, murdering the Fathers by the Sons, and Brother by Brother,
Soveraigns by Subjects, and one Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince by another; that we read in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory more
Chri≈øtian and Royal Blood ≈øhed by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> than ever was ≈øhed by all the
Enemies of the Church of God, ≈øince God had a Church on earth. While then the Pope acts thus
mo≈øt bloodily and mo≈øt bea≈øtly, and yet calls him≈øelf <hi>Mo≈øt Holy:</hi> We an≈øwer
from the Holy Gho≈øt; <hi>Maromah; The Lord of Rome ≈øpeaketh lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, He lyeth by his Emi≈ø≈øaries. For the≈øe are taught and teach; That to Lye and
Equivocate is their Duty, when it ≈øerves their Ma≈øters turn. Therefore they Equivocate in their
Names, and Habits, and Profe≈ø≈øions, changing them every day, and often in a day, as the weather
of their Affairs changeth. They equivocate in their Doctrines, re≈øolving their Ca≈øes and
Controver≈øies, as may ≈øerve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all manner of Pro≈øelytes. They Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at the Barr
of Ju≈øtice, holding Murders
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65085:17"/> and Ma≈ø≈øacres to be ju≈øt, and no Oaths ≈øo lawful as ≈øuch as ≈øerve
to conceal their Plots. They Equivocate on their private death-beds, and give up their Gho≈øt with
Oaths of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; as is certain of <hi>Tre≈øham</hi>'s Ca≈øe in King <hi>James</hi> his
time, acknowledged by <hi>Garnet</hi> him≈øelf. What wonder then if they dye on the Gallows with
Oaths of Equivocation! We are ≈øure the Murderers of Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> dyed with
Lyes, or (which is the mo≈øt deceitful kind of lyes) with Equivocation and horrid Execration
denying that bloody Fact. We are ≈øure they dyed Lying. What wonder if the Plotters dyed in a
lying or equivocating Denyal of the Plot. We are ≈øure <hi>Ireland</hi> dyed Lying; why not the
Re≈øt! e≈øpecially <hi>Gawen,</hi> who in his la≈øt words tells ye of <hi>Material
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution,</hi> a new and fine way of Deceit; when a Je≈øuit may ≈øpeak what words he will;
but means nothing but the ≈øound of the words, but leaves the hearer to give what ≈øignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he will, and to deceive him≈øelf if he will, <hi>Si vult decipi, decipiatur. I think it
nece≈ø≈øary,</hi> ≈øays the Je≈øuit, <hi>to ≈øpeak the≈øe words, but I mean no ≈øuch
thing.</hi> Thus the Life and Death of an Emi≈ø≈øary of <hi>Rome,</hi> is Lying, Equivocation,
or, as the Martyrs of lyes have taught us, <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65085:18"/> Prolocution.</hi> As Chri≈øt is the great Author of Truth, and came to bear
witne≈øs to the Truth, and to ≈øave all by the Truth: Even ≈øo it is apparent, that the Lord of
<hi>Rome</hi> walks in direct Oppo≈øition to Chri≈øt; is the great Author of Deceit, and by all
methods of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ≈øeeks to deceive all. Therefore the Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Antichri≈øt.
And of him in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to the Chri≈øt, <hi>Solomon</hi> prophe≈øied: <hi>A true Witne≈øs
delivereth Souls, but</hi> Maromah, <hi>the Lord of Rome ≈øpeaketh Lies.</hi>
